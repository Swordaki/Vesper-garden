The Gluttony ring houses many differences in Hell's culture. This is a culture of blood, blood is the food, the money and blood is the wealth. This is home to the Ulavere (Those who stay in their Bloodtinged forms) and the Sanguine (Those who only go into bloodtinged when it is time for 'the feast')

The first thing to note about gluttony is that it wasn't always the ring of blood, but became one after [[1. Hell/1.2 Characters/The Katasine Family/Lucian Marline]] and his wife, [[Saline Katasine]] got together, and started working with [[Archeia]] in that ring, where they used Saline's powers and altered them, seeing how far they could stretch her blood's prowess.

That eventually formed [[The Sanguine family]] and [[The Ulavere Family]] respectively.
