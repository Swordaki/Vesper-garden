## General Description
---
Lucian Marline is the first son of [[Yin Marline]].
He is a tall man with sharp cheek bones and a strong draw, his lips are lush yet thin and pale like his skin, and his eyes glow past his half-open lids and stand out in contrast of his almost vampiric appearance.

He wears a leather coat, fitted with trinkets pooling or hanging out of his pockets, and beneath his coat is a white collared shirt and black tie covered with a pendant featuring a golden compass.

His pants are also leather, along with his boots.
