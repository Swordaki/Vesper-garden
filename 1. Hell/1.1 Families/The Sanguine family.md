Sanguine family has actually been killing people for cannibalising on their own, instead making the argument that the demons there don't need demon meat, but blood.
Whether this is true or not is up for debate, but what we do know is that they've starved the community of what they need. And it seems that they've put something into the blood that has turned it into a drug.
Why...?
That's still a mystery.
