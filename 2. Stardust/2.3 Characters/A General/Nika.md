## General Info
---
Nika Katasine is the daughter of Velia and Darian Katasine, and after their death, she's become the new head of [[Katasine Family]]. She's a bit quirky, overconfident and in over her head a lot of the time...but in reality her cockiness is a reflection of her trying to live up to those expectations
"I never liked them you know...my parents, but when you lose something you didn't know you had..."
"So that's why i have to be the best, so I can be the person they wanted me to be."
"And I'm never gonna stop being the best, even if i have to take the crown from that Kusogaki 
([[Kisu]])"

## Backstory

## Narrative role

## Abilities
---
{AD Regen}: Because of her blood's properties, she's able to regenerate much faster than most demons, and it makes her exceptionally hard to kill...however she isn't invulnerable to being hurt. She isn't immune to pain, so she basically has to hurt herself often, so that she can actually use her powers in a fight. This also adds opportunity for her to grow...the more she's able to handle the pain and not break under the mental pressure, the more she's able to hold up the fight, and use her power.
