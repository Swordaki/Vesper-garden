![[Akihiko.png]]
## General Description
---
A 19 year old Emperium young man, gifted with machinery; Most Notably prosthetics. He is a pupil of the Redhood Giovanni, a student at Ama-college and the 3rd member in squad 1. Everything that is made of metal or plastic he wears, is his own handiwork.
## Backstory
---
His earliest memories are from his time in the Lady’s Manor, which was shortly destroyed in an Azure explosion that lead to the loss of his legs, half of his left arm, and his right hand. The burns from the explosion also damaged his lungs considerably. He was found floating down a river he had fallen into by a young Jiro Phenix. The Phenix family of recently two, nursed Akihiko back to health, and took him in as their own. With their support, he found his love for tinkering, and built his 1st pair of legs by the time he was 7. Years later, Akihiko and Jiro impressed the RedHood Giovanni, so much so he took the boys under his wing for a few years. In present day Akihiko remains a bit lost, trying to heal from his past, both in body in mind, while also trying to build something without tools or his hands: a friendship.
## Narrative Role
---
Direct supporting side character. From a story standpoint, his goal as a character is to support the others around him, primarily the main character: [[Kisu]]. He is a genuine and trustworthy companion, possible future love interest.
Akihiko views Kisu as a step in the right direction, a Light down a new path. Her kindness led him to traveling to the Citadel, and as chaotic and painful as its been... His loyalty towards her hasnt wavered. He saw a special joy in her smile, one he's only ever seen in his best friend... So he wants to do everything he can to make it easier for her to smile. While he's much softer and reserved about it, subconsciously he wants to do for her what Jiro did for him: And right now that means being there for her when she needs it.
## Abilities
---
On his own, he is a wonderful strategist and repair man, able to get nearly any gear or vehicle working again if given enough time. With his Suit however, he’s a force to be reckoned with. Powered primarily by crystallized Arcana, his fully realized suit is capable of supporting a building, and blasting super concentrated air for propulsion and long range. His suit is sluggish when low on power, and said power is used for his strongest attacks. He prefers to keep his distance in fights, as while he is extremely dangerous up close, he’s quite choreographed and obvious.
## Trivia and Links
---
He is NOT a morning person, but because of his bodies state, he can’t remain asleep for more than 6 hours. 
Akihiko is a big fan of Jazzy Music He would recalibrate his hands by braiding Jiro’s hair. 
Because Jiro isn’t around, he recalibrates by tying knots with any extra wires he has laying around. He has a few ticks that can be dead giveaways, but I’ll only reveal one: he used to play with a loose screw on his wrist, but now that he has his hands, he fiddles with his sleeve.
Looking at the left cuff of any of his shirts, you’ll find a loose tread, likely pulled and tied multiple times over. 
Akihiko is touch starved. 
Especially in his hands Akihiko is very proud of his fluffy hair Sunsets make him tear up, bar none. He has a solid chance of crying while watching movies He hates Chips. 
Specifically the sound of them. It grates him like a knife. 
He loves little things, like animals, toys, trinkets, jewelry, etc. His right chest plate, when removed, has the names of people he trusts fully wielded into the plate. 
Jiro, Mrs. Phenix, Sensei Tritio currently are engraved. 
He has an addiction to expensive cologne and perfumes- to the point he has a separate filtration system inside his suit that constantly leaves it smelling like oak forests or meadows of gentle flowers ~~he is of course nose blind to his own smell like everyone else~~ 
And last one off the top of my head is: He has an issue with staring at people with white hair that aren’t elderly
