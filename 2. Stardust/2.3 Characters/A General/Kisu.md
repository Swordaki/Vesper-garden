## Kisu Roseingrave Morningstar, Princess of Hell, Dominion of The Citadel

## General Description
---
Kisu's character hinges on the expectation of others, and her approach to those expectations. By all means, she's a seinen protagonist at the heart of many of my darker works. And that's generally because she has heightened regeneration because of the god locked within her.
