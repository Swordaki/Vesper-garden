This journey started in [[Kiliden Bastius]] after Zenith's meeting with [[The Dragon Council]] in which they had come to an agreement that [[Leylines]] should be closed off due to the emerging [[Anomalies]], which they would later find out occured as consequence to the arrival of [[Morrigan]].

After the journey she would regroup with her husband [[Elijah]] and relay her info to both him and [[Kisu]].


[[Zenith]] took around a year, with 9 months of travel time to go from the upper area of [[Zahra Desert]], to Adravi's capital [[Amonia]].
With this she tracked her journey to determine just how big the Citadel was, as a part of her journaling. 
From Zenith's notebook she figured she was walking about 5 km/h and that she was traveling around 8 hours a day. She then recorded her trek through the days and found at the end of her journey that she travelled 10 920 kms, which made her come to the conclusion that the citadel was about 10 950 kms from North to South accounting for borders.
