The scenario:
You have four choices on what to do in this scenario
1. There's a skrimish in your village. The front gate has collapsed and invaders are harming your neighbors. You are frustrated. The sight of stretchers carrying your school mates frightens you, and you choose to go and fight in the skirmish
2. The sight of your schoolmates drives you to follow them into the medical tents, and you attempt to help where you can.
3. The king calls your name and tells you to grab a bow and arrow and fend off the oncoming reinforcements.
4. You are afraid. The sight of your fellow classmates scares you, and you run out the village-side entrance to hide and protect your family.
